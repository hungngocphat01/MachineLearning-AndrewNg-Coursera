This repository comprises of my answers for the programming assignments of the Machine Learning course by Prof. Andrew Ng on Coursera.  

Programming language: Octave (6.2.0). As Python is quite ubiquitous in the field of machine learning nowadays, for each exercise I also implement a Python (3.9) script/Jupyter notebook that does the equivalent tasks as in the Octave scripts. Sometimes I only implement the more general functions (example: multi-variate instead of single-variate).

What have been implemented:
- **Week 1:** Linear Regression (single and multi-variate).
- **Week 2:** Logistic Regression.
- **Week 3:** Feed-forward and One-vs-all [no Python].
